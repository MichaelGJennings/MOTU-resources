This is a collection of ittle goodies that make using MOTU products like Digital Performer just a little better.

## Bundle files

### UAD Apollo x6
I found a nice way to set up the bundle for a Universal Audio Apollo x6 interface (Thunderbolt) so that you can more easily route things to and from the outputs and inputs, rather than with the generic Thunderbolt port name.  It works in mono or stereo and I hope it saves you some time.  Add it to your template.

Press shift-U in the Tracks window, select <em>Import bundle…</em> and locate the <em>UAD-Apollo-X6</em> .bundle file.
